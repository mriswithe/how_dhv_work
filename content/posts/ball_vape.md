## Introduction
Ball Vapes are a type of marijuana vaporizer. They are called such, because part of the heating mechanism is a loose bunch of lab grown ruby balls. I am going to go over the components, and an explanation of how they work together.

## Raw Components
There are many pieces in a ball vape, below are listed the main components. 

* Metal Cylinder {{< figure src="/b2_body.jpg" title="The Metal Cylinder" width=200 >}}
* Heating Coil {{< figure src="/coil.jpg" title="Heating Coil" width=200 >}}
* Heating Coil Controller (PID) {{< figure src="/pid.jpg" title="PID" width=200 >}}
* Lab grown rubies {{< figure src="/rubies.jpg" title="Rubies" width=200 >}}
* Heater Stand {{< figure src="/stand2.jpg" title="Heater Stand" width=200 >}}
* Glass/Metal Bowl {{< figure src="/bowl.jpg" title="Bowl" width=200 >}}
* Waterpipe/Bong {{< figure src="/bong.jpg" title="Bong" width=200 >}}
* Long metal pick (Definitely probably not a murder weapon) {{< figure src="/pick.jpg" title="Not for murder!" width=200 >}}

### Metal Cylinder
The metal cylinder is the shell that holds the rubies, the heating coil is wrapped around the metal body, some models leave it exposed, some cover it. The job of the metal cylinder is to be the first thing to take in heat from the heating coil. Warning: This metal cylinder is going to be ~600 Degrees Fahrenheit when it is in operation. Try not to touch it. 
### Heating Coil
The source of heat in our vaporizer. Turns electricity into heat, similar in function/technology to the [burners on electric stoves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_stove). 
### Heating Coil Controller (PID) 
The heating coil needs something to keep it at the temperature we want. That is the job of the PID or controller. Essentially, only feeds power to the coil when the coil isn't already at temp. For detailed knowledge, check out this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). TL;DR; chip does math, too spicy, less power, not spicy enough, more power
### Lab grown rubies 
The rubies are being used to store heat. In the same way that touching something hot burns your hand (conduction) these rubies get brought up to the desired temperature by being in contact with each other and the metal shell the heating coil is wrapped around. Rubies are used because they are relatively cheap, and they do not react at the temperatures involved.
### Heater Stand 
The heater stand is where you keep the metal cylinder when it is not being used so it doesn't set your desk on fire, destroy your table, or other such things. A heat resistant receptacle for your spicy metal cylinder. 
### Glass/Metal Bowl 
The bowl is where your plant matter goes. Ground bud, some do concentrate as well, but that is advanced usage, we are not covering here. This will both serve to hold your marijuana as well as the perfect place to set your spicy metal cylinder when you want to vaporize THC.
### Waterpipe / Bong
The vapor that comes out from a ball vape is generally pretty hot, and many find it more reasonable to pass it through a bong or waterpipe first. Some will not put water in the bong, some will, these are personal preference/tolerance (to heat) choices.
### Metal Pick
This is used to poke at stuff on the metal cylinder to make sure they are in place firmly. Also, a very good pick for clearing the holes on the bowl. Be careful, this thing is very pointy!!
## Combined Components
Once you assemble the Ball Vape, you are basically left with four pqieces.
* Hot can on a stick
  * Metal Cylinder
  * Heating Coil
  * Rubies
* Controller (PID)
* Bowl + Bong
* Heater stand
* Metal Pick

## Description of heating method
Vaporizers heat marijuana to vaporize THC. This one is no different. The heat in this one is produced by an electric heating coil. This heats up the metal cylinder, which contains many red lab grown ruby balls. The rubies get hot due to contact with the metal cylinder. This is what we are waiting for with the 6 minute timer. {{< figure src=/body_with_rubies.jpg width=200 title="Heating coil wraps wround the section that contains the rubies" >}} Once it is hot, and the bowl is on the waterpipe, and the cylinder is in place, you pull through the waterpiece, this pulls room temperature in from above the metal cylinder. Most of the way through the metal cylinder is blocked by super hot rubies, so the air bumps into the rubies a lot (Stealing some of their warmth each time). By the time the air gets out of the bottom of the metal cylinder, it is extremely hot and ready to vaporize some THC. 

## Usage
1. Ensure the metal cylinder is on the stand
2. Turn on the device
3. Set temperature to 600°F (First time only), this is persistent
4. Set Timer for 6 minutes
5. Put ground marijuana into the bowl and tamp
6. Put bowl on the input hole of your water pipe
7. Wait until the timer expires
8. Set the metal cylinder (USING THE HANDLE) on the bowl, depending on style it may fit differently, but the cylinder will fit inside the bowl (Injector), or around the bowl (Diffuser)
9. (Optional) Wait 15-20 seconds to let the bowl get hot, this can change how much vapor is produced and how thick it is
10. Put your mouth on the mouth hole. Breathe in. If you can see the bong's main chamber, keep an eye on it for how thick the vapor looks to gauge when to stop
11. Stop when you want, I'm not your mom
12. Put the metal cylinder on its heater stand
13. Remember, the glass/metal bowl is now pretty close to 600°F
14. CAREFULLY!!! Stir with the long metal pick, then retamp
15. If you are ready for more, set the cylinder on the bowl again and do it again.
16. Repeat until your bud (now ABV or Already Been Vaped) is dark brown or you don't like how it tastes anymore (If it tasted bad to start, well that's just a feature. Some weeds seem to have plenty of the dirt terpene, whichever that is.)
17. If the bud ends up black like used coffee grounds, or catches on fire, you have gone too far
